# diamond-square
An implementation of the diamond-square terrain generation algorithm

Biggest issue that it is generated in a "square" fashion due to how the program recurses. Fix could be coming.

Can view the output image in any terrain generator that accepts an image as a heightmap; an online one is [here](http://cpetry.github.io/NormalMap-Online/).
